// Changes: rewritten for MSTest assertions; a test of UnicodeString, which upstream does not test, is added, and so are
// tests of NonZeroInt with 0 at either end of its range and from 0 to 0, of Odd and Even at the ends of their range,
// and of DateOnly and TimeOnly, which upstream does not have.
